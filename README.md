# Simple Ray Tracer - Rust #

The intention of this project is to have a meaningful program to create while I am learning the Rust programming language.

This program produces ray-traced images with various lighting effects, including diffuse and specular lighting, reflection, and refraction.  Spheres and planes are currently supported, along with spherical light sources.  Output images are produced in the PPM file format, due to its simplicity.  

I have no intention of making this an actively evolving project.  It exists solely for my own amusement and to help me learn.   This program contains some meaningful programming abstractions that help me to test out various features of the Rust programming language, including:

- Data structures
- Generics 
- Recursion
- File I/O
- Concurrency

The design of this program is entirely my own, but the concepts and ideas were heavily influenced by the following:
